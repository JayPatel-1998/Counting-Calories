Counting Calories is a program built in Python 2.7. Its purpose is to recommend the calorie intake, based on a persons age,gender and lifestyle. The user can then compare their own calorie intake to the recommended one. The first part of the program consists of entering personal information and meal choices (Breakfast,Lunch,Dinner,Snacks and Desserts) from our set menus.
